# To Do App

# Getting Started with To-Do React App

To begin with:
Replace The Public and src in your react app once you complete installing react globally by using 
`npm install -g create-react-app` afterwords Create App using `npx create-react-app my-app`
Change your directory to my-app using `cd my-app`
To Run the app write `npm start` in your terminal(I highly recommend  you use VS Code Editor)



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

And this is how my Mobile Friendly React To-Do App looks like.
